# Run Existing Model -- Image processing

In this section, you’ll work your way through a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use a built-in algorithm in SageMaker. More specifically, you’ll use SageMaker’s image classification algorithm, a supervised learning algorithm that takes an image as input and classifies it into one of multiple output categories. It uses a convolutional neural network (ResNet) that can be trained from scratch, or trained using transfer learning when a large number of training images are not available. In this section you’ll train the image classification algorithm from scratch on the Caltech-256 dataset.

## Set up the data

- Upload Step3-RunExistingModel/src/prepareData-image.ipynb to your Sagemaker Studio notebook
- This time select "MXnet CPU optimized" kernel

- Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook

## Running Training and Inference

- Upload Step3-RunExistingModel/src/createModelandRunInference-image.ipynb to your Sagemaker Studio notebook
- Select "MXnet CPU optimized" kernel again
- Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook
